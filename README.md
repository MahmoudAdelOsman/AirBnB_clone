# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

## Project Overview

This project involves building an AirBnB clone, which is the first step towards creating a full-fledged web application. This initial phase is crucial as it forms the foundation for all subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

## Objectives

During this project, you will:

- Implement a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.
- Establish a parent class named `BaseModel` responsible for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- Set up a simple flow for serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create various classes (such as User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from `BaseModel`.
- Develop the initial abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

## Command Interpreter for AirBnB Clone Project

### Overview

The command interpreter, often referred to as a shell, is a program that allows users to interact with a computer system by typing in text-based commands. It acts as an interface between the user and the underlying operating system, facilitating the execution of various tasks and operations.

In the context of the AirBnB clone project, the command interpreter serves as a specialized shell tailored to specific functionalities. Its primary purpose is to manage the objects within the project, which includes tasks such as:

- **Creating New Objects**: This involves the creation of new instances of objects, like a new User or a new Place.

- **Retrieving Objects**: The command interpreter allows users to retrieve objects from various sources, such as files or databases, enabling access to previously stored information.

- **Performing Operations on Objects**: Users can carry out operations on objects, which may include tasks like counting the number of objects, computing statistics, and more.

- **Updating Attributes**: The command interpreter provides a means to modify the attributes of existing objects, allowing for dynamic changes to object properties.

- **Destroying Objects**: This involves the removal or deletion of objects from the system.
